<h4>Examples Overview</h4>

<p>
  Heist is a Haskell templating library commonly used with the Snap Framework.
  Heist keeps business logic out of the templates by giving you facilities for
  manipulating the templates in code. For instance, extracting and repeating
  template nodes from code instead of having a special template syntax for
  looping and conditions.

<p>
  This site is designed to demonstrate a few of the flow control basics common
  to other templating systems, such as looping (mapping, in this case) and
  conditionally rendering text or conditionally injecting other templates.
